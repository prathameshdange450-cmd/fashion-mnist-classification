# fashion-mnist-classification

* developed a deep learning model to classify fashion-mnist images into 10 clothing categories using tensorflow keras

* desinged a Sequential neural network architecture with

   1) fully connected hidden layer of 500 meurons using relu activation
 
   2) output layerwith 10 neurons for multiclass classification
 
   3) applied categorical cross-entropy loss with stochastic gradient descent optimizer

* trained the model for 100 epochs
   training accuracy is 95%
   final loss 0.13

* evaluted model performance using acccuracy metrics and training loss trends across epochs

* implemented the project using python, numpy,tensorflow,keras,pandas
